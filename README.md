# Data-Analyst-Project-Identifying-and-Recommending-Best-Restaurants-Python
# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to leverage Python for data analysis and tableau for visualization to identify and recommend the best restaurants in a given area. The project aims to extract insights from a dataset containing information about various restaurants, including customer reviews, ratings, cuisine types, and other relevant attributes. By employing advanced data analysis techniques, the goal is to develop a recommendation system that assists users in selecting the most suitable dining options based on their preferences.
